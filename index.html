            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>Since November 2023, weâ€™ve been working on multiple projects via our leisure time on ROBLOX. Weâ€™ve always had that â€˜goalâ€™ of opening a recreation based of our favourite theme park weâ€™ve visited - that being THROPE PARK - located in Surrey, UK. ðŸŽ¢
    
                We plan to not just bring a (planned) award-winning recreation to your own very eyes via a screen, but to create new friendships on multiple platforms. Alongside that, to connect users that share the same passion as each other all â€˜round the world. We are delighted to welcome you, our â€˜feel good thrillsâ€™ branded experience that can be easily accessed to anyone around the world, all just by owning a free ROBLOX account.
                
                Humbly,
                ðŸ”¹THROPE PARK - Online ðŸ”¸
